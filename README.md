# Chess2030 - Rules

At the moment this is where the rules are kept
I am currently trying to dense down the files and make them more simpler.
Also i wish to finish the menu bar.

Here is a list of what i am going to do.

- [ ] opppasount
- [ ] pawn exchange
- [ ] castling
- [ ] check
- [ ] checkmate
- [ ] cleaning up

***Once this is done please check The [Master_Branch](https://github.com/Taonga07/Chess2030) for when it is realed there!***
