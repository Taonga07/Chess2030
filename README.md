This is a two player game; playing against computer is not an option yet but could be.
Currently the master branch holds the best code. so will 
The rules are being developed at the moment. Get an example in the rules branch where we are currently working on pawn rules.
The master branch will be updated when all errors and imperfections are dealt with in other branches.
